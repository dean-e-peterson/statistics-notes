## 5.1 Introduction

A *probability model* has

* $\Omega$ - The **sample space**, the set of possible outcomes.
* $A$ - An **event** - A collection of outcomes
$$
\begin{align*}
A &= \{\omega_1, \omega_2, \cdots, \omega_n\} \\
A &= \{\omega ; \omega \text{ has property } \mathcal P\}
\end{align*}
$$
* $P$ - **Probability** - A function that assigns a number to each event.

**Probability** - A branch of mathematics based on 3 axioms originally inspired by games of chance.

1. $P(A) \geq 0$
2. $P(\Omega) = 1$
3. If two events are **mutually exclusive** or **disjoint** (i.e. $A \cap B = \emptyset$), then $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$
*  For the calculus version of axiom 3, for mutually exclusive events...
$$ P\left( \, \bigcup_{j=1}^\infty A_j \right) = \sum_{j=1}^\infty P(A_j)$$
