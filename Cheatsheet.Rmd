## Terms

**Population** - The entire group of things that we ultimately want to learn about.

**Sample** - A subset of the population which we study to learn about the *population*.

**Statistic** - A property of the sample.  Used to estimate a *parameter* of the *population*.

**Parameter** - A property of the population.  Estimated by a *statistic* of the *sample*.

**Qualitative** - Categorical.  Example brown, blue, green, gray.

**Quantitative** - Numerical.  Example, a count of people or a measurement of an amount of water.

**Discrete** - Non-continuous *quantitative* data.  Things that can be counted.  Example, you can have 4 or 5 people, but not 4 1/2 people.

**Continuous** - *Quantitative* data that can be measured continuously.  Example, amount of water, you can have 4 gallons, 5 gallons, 4.5 gallons, 4.0001 gallons, etc.

### Levels of Measurement

**Nominal scale** - Unordered *categorical* data.  Example, favorite foods.  Sushi is not inherently less than or greater than pizza.

**Ordinal scale** - Ordered *categorical* data.  You can put them in order, but the difference between values cannot be measured.  Example, "strongly agree", "agree", "disagree", "strongly disagree".

**Interval scale** - Ordered *quantitative* data where differences can be measured, but ratios cannot be taken because there is no true 0 point.  Example, Fahrenheit scale, where the difference between 60 and 80 is 20, but where 80 is not four times as hot as 20.

**Ratio scale** - Ordered *quantitative* data where differences and ratios can both be calculated.  Example, Kelvin scale or test scores counted from 0.

### Random Sampling
"A sample should have the same characteristics as the population it is representing." - [OpenSTAX Introductory Statistics](https://openstax.org/details/books/introductory-statistics) book, by Barbara Illowsky and Susan Dean.

**Simple Random Sample** - Each sample of the same size is equally likely.

**Stratified Sample** - Divide population into groups called strata, and take a proportionate number from each stratum.

**Cluster Sample** - Divide population into groups called clusters, randomly select some clusters, and take all members from the selected clusters.

**Systematic Sample** - Randomly select a starting point, then take every n<sup>th</sup> item from a listing, wrapping around to the start.  Example, 20,000 names in a phone book, to get a sample of 400, choose a starting point and pick every 50<sup>th</sup> name.

**Convenience Sample** - *NOT random!  May be highly biased!*  Just use sample that is easily gotten.

Sampling can be done with or without replacement.  True random sampling is done **with replacement**, where the same member of a population can be chosen more than once.  However, with a large population and small sample, sampling **without replacement** is approximately the same, and more frequently done.

## Probability

$$P(E|F)\text{ Probability of E given F}$$
$$P(E~and~F) = P(E|F)P(F)$$
$$P(E|F) = \frac{P(E~and~F)}{P(F)}$$
$$P(E) = P(E|F)\text{ iff E and F are independent}$$
Bayes Theorem
$$P(E|F) = \frac{P(E)P(F|E)}{P(E)P(F|E) + P(not~E)P(F|not~E)} = \frac{P(E)P(F|E)}{P(F)}$$

## Descriptive Statistics

Note that relative frequency $\frac{n_x}{n}$ approaches probability $p(x)$ as sample size increases.
